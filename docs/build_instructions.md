##Build Instructions

There is nothing special needed to build this app. Simply clone or download from my github 
repository. Import into IntelliJ or Android Studio by using checkout from version control. 
After the program has finished loading it is necessary to sync the gradle build by selecting 
the sync now option when prompted. Finally just click the run button and wait for the selected 
device to start and run the application.
