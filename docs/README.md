# Audio Pop 

This project was created with the intention of providing a useful tool that is readily available to
anybody with the need to detect speaker polarity. A single speaker being out of phase can reduce 
sound quality and in some cases is not so easy to detect as looking at the connections to ensure 
positive is to positive and same for negative.

I have included and used -musicg library in the creation and development of this app.

I have included -Google Sign In as an external service to be consumed by this app.
