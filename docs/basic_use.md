When the app is ran for the first time the first thing you are prompted with is a google sign in.
After the entry and verification of user id, you will the be at a setup screen which allows the 
creation of a new setup. A new setup consists of a name for the setup, an option to choose whether
the gear installed or being used is stock or aftermarket and finally an area to write yourself any 
pretest notes. At the bottom of this layout you have the choice of skipping or saving the setup, 
either of which will the direct you to the test layout. At this point the only option on this layout 
is Mono test. When the button is pressed the app will output a signal through the speaker being 
tested, listen and compare to signal to determine whether the speaker is playing a positive or 
negative signal. After the test, you can enter notes for the current test and save. The final page
is the results page where you can see a list of setups you have created. Upon selection of one of 
these setups you will be shown the details of said setup and a list of test performed for that setup.
All of the options are currently available through the navigation drawer allowing you to skip or 
jump to whatever area you would like to display. However, results are only saved and displayed if 
you go through the process of creating and saving a setup and test for that setup.
